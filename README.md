# Limits of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

## Overview

This notebook explores and highlights the limitations of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). While ANNs have shown great success in various applications, they are not without their constraints. Understanding these limitations is crucial for practitioners to make informed decisions about model selection and problem-solving strategies.

## Key Limitations:

1. **Non-Linearity vs. Linearity**: ANNs are inherently non-linear models, which can be advantageous for complex tasks. However, they might struggle with linear problems, where a linear model could perform equally well or better. This limitation emphasizes the importance of selecting an appropriate model for the nature of the problem.

2. **Overfitting**: ANNs, especially deep networks, are prone to overfitting, especially when dealing with limited training data. Overfitting occurs when the model learns noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization on new, unseen data.

3. **Computational Resources**: Training deep neural networks requires significant computational resources. Large models with numerous parameters demand powerful hardware, and training times can be prolonged. This limitation poses challenges, particularly for individuals or organizations with limited computational resources.

4. **Need for Large Datasets**: ANNs often perform better with large datasets for training. When faced with small datasets, the risk of overfitting increases, and the model may struggle to generalize well.

5. **Interpretability**: ANNs are often referred to as "black-box" models, making it challenging to interpret how they arrive at specific predictions. This lack of interpretability can be a drawback in applications where transparency and understanding the decision-making process are critical.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Successfully training ANNs requires tuning various hyperparameters, such as learning rates, architecture, and regularization parameters. Finding the optimal combination can be time-consuming and may require extensive experimentation.

## Application:

- **Model Selection**: Understanding the limitations of ANNs helps practitioners make informed decisions about whether to use them or opt for simpler models for specific tasks.

- **Data Considerations**: When working with linear problems or limited datasets, it may be more suitable to consider simpler models that do not suffer from overfitting issues.

- **Interpretability Trade-offs**: In applications where interpretability is crucial, such as healthcare or finance, practitioners might opt for models with more transparent decision-making processes.

By recognizing these limitations, practitioners can navigate the challenges associated with ANNs and make better-informed choices based on the nature of the problem at hand.
